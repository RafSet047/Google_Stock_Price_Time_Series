# Google_Stock_Price_Time_Series
This Repo is Milestone Project from the Udemy course of Daniel Bourke - Zero to Mastery of Tensorflow
https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/

In this notebooks different models were implemented for predicting the Google Stock prices.

In the Part1
All models were implemented in actual prices without scaling. 
Before the models the naive and moving average methods are also tried then for comparing them with DL models.
In the first part models with different window sizes are tried. With window sizes the data became an ordinary cross-sectional data.

In the Part2
New features were added like other big tech companies' prices and industrial indexes. Models have in that notebook 2 branches of inputs.
